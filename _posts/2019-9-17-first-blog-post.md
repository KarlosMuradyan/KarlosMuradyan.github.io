Scylla is a modert ai-based protective intelligence suite that enhances operational activities of law enforement in the three main areas: Preventive Threat Detection, Vehicle Identification and Tracking, Smart suspect identification system. Scylla connects with your existing security camera system. At the core of Scylla, there are two main threat recognition modules and one smart decision maker. The smart decision maker - Charon works on top of the two main threat recognition modules to make a final decision. We run the video frame through our deep learning algorithm, and if a detection is made, Scylla will send an alert with the detected frame to your security team or designated staff. The average mass shooting lasts 12.5 minutes, yet it takes law enforcement an average of 18 minutes to neutralize the threat. Scylla AI provides real-time intelligence to first responders on where the shooter is, what heâ€™s armed and equipped with, what he looks like, and how many shooters there are. This information allows law enforcement to much more rapidly locate and neutralize the threat, and for emergency medical personnel to render aid to the wounded. If there is a security officer on staff, Scylla AI increases the probability for an intervention before shots are fired.
