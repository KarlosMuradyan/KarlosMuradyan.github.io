I'm Data Scientist at Develandoo, which is an AI company based in Germany. I already have 1 year of working experience in this field. I got experience and did number of projects with deep neural networks and classical machine learning algorithms. Some of the projects where I got state-of-the-art results are: gender retrivial from first name (classical ml algorithm), violence detection from videos (Convolutional LSTMs), melanoma classification (CNNs). The main language of my job is Python. For the models, I used Pytorch and Tensorflow libraries. <br>
Simultaneously, I'm studying in UBC to get Master of Data Science degree. The program lasts one year and I expect to graduate on January 2020.
### More Information

I have some experience in different fields other than Data Science, too. I first started my IT career with Web programming. I was an intern as a front-end web developer, but shortly I started doing Software Engineering. I worked over one year in Armenian based start-up, named "Leviathan" and simultaneously done Penetration Testing practice in ArmSec academy.
